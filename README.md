# Google-Playstore-Apps-Analysis
The objective of the project is to check the assertiveness, complexion and diversity of apps
available on Google play store and how people are engaging towards them on the whole. Vast
visualization algorithms have been applied to get the best outcome for each sub data set. Some of
them include- Top Condition filter, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Context Filter. To conclude we can
say that apps which fall under GAMES category play a huge impact on both the producer and
the consumer.
I designed a Tableau dashboard analyzing Google Play Store data to visualize assertiveness, complexion and diversity of apps using Tableau and SQL.
